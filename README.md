# All CS:S Tricksurf Maps 

These maps are all edited specifically for tricksurf, with all weapons, func_breakables, func_buttons, and other unnecessary elements removed(some exceptions), and some triggers changed.

# IMPORTANT: In 0.8.5 the prefix for tricksurf is tricksurf_ ; however, on the github the maps have the prefix tsurf_ in preparation for the eventual arrival of tricksurf. Please rename the map prefixes to tricksurf_ until the update changes the required prefix. Also if you change the name of the map make sure to rebuild cube maps with "buildcubemaps" in console.

***Trigger images can also be found on the google drive along with json files with the trick names.***
